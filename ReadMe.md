This program is based on The Coding Train's Coding Challege #4: "Purple Rain." The video that is showcases this challege is linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkyIDI6rQJI&t=564s). In the video, he programs using javascript in a p5.js and Processing. 
Wanting to undertake this challenge, I wrote a program that utilizes HTML and basic JavaScript.
I used the following:
  - Visual Studio Code -- a code editor that allows the Live Server plugin
  - HTML5 and JavaScript -- Canvas was the image feature used in Javascript, and HTML runs the JS file.
  - Live Server -- a plugin Ritwick Dey that runs a live server for the html project, allowing for realtime manipulation
